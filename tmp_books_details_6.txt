A Faith‑Based Journey Toward Healing After Loss  
Daily Scriptures, Reflections, and Guided Prayers for the Grieving Heart  
Amazon Link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FDGYXDTM   
 
1. Dear Mama, You Are Not Alone  
Grief is not a straight line.  
 It is a sacred, winding journey —quiet some days, overwhelming on others.  
Whether your loss is fresh or many years behind you…  
 Whether you speak about it openly or carry it silently…  
 Whether your arms feel empty or your heart feels heavy…  
Please hear this:  
You are still a mother.  
 Your love is still real.  
 And you are not walking alone.  
God sees every tear you wipe away.  
 He hears every prayer you can’t put into words.  
 He walks with you, even in the darkest valleys.  
 
2. A Journal Created for Your Tender Heart  
Still a Good Mom Even When You’re Grieving was created for the mother who 
loves deeply and grieves quietly (or loudly), faithfully, and honestly.  
This journal is not meant to rush your healing.  
 It will never tell you to “move on.”  
 It will never demand strength you don’t have today.  
Instead, it offers you:  
🕊 A safe place to breathe  
 📖 God’s Word to anchor your heart  
 🤍 Gentle reflections for heavy days  
 🙏 Guided prayers when your own words fall short  
 ✍️ Space to remember, release, cry, and heal —at your own pace  
 
3. What You’ll Find Inside  
Each day includes:  
● Scripture to remind you that God is near  
 
● A short, compassionate reflection  
 
● A guided prayer for your hurting heart  
 
● Space to write honestly —if and when you’re ready  
 
You may use one page a day…  
 one page a week…  
 or pause and return when your heart allows.  
This journal is a companion, not a task.  
 
4. There Is No Right Way to Grieve  
Some days you may write pages.  
 Some days you may only read a verse.  
 Some days you may close the book and simply breathe.  
All of it is okay.  
Healing does not mean forgetting.  
 Strength does not mean silence.  
 Faith does not mean you never feel broken.  
It means you keep showing up —softly, imperfectly, bravely.  
 
5. This Journal Is For You If…  
● You are grieving the loss of a child (at any age or stage)  
 
● You feel guilt, sadness, anger, confusion, or emptiness  
 
● You want a faith ‑centered space to process your pain  
 
● You need gentle guidance without pressure  
 
● You want to remember your child while caring for your heart  
 
It is also a meaningful gift for a grieving mother who needs comfort beyond 
words.  
 
6. A Gentle Reminder  
You are still held.  
 You are still loved.  
 You are still a good mom.  
 And your story matters —every single word of it.  
Let this journal walk with you through the silence, the questions, the tears, and 
the tiny moments of peace.  
God is near.  
 Your love remains.  
 And healing, however slow, is still possible.

Being a stay -at-home mom can be beautiful, but it can also feel incredibly 
isolating. You pour your heart into your family —nurturing, teaching, cleaning,

understands the silent struggl es you carry. The quiet of an empty house, the 
endless demands of children, and the pressure to “have it all together” can leave 
your heart heavy and lonely.  
Here’s the truth: You are not alone. God sees you, knows your heart, and is 
walking with you through every sleepless night, every overwhelmed moment, and 
every quiet sigh.
